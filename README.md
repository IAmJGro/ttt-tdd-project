# ttt-tdd-project

This is a node-based Tic-Tac-Toe game, built as part of the aaOpen syllabus. It is based on a starter that included the
screen.js and command.js files and a skeleton of ttt.js. Much of ttt.js and basically all of cursor.js and computer-player.js
were programmed by IAmJGro.

Basic moves:

WASD to move your cursor
E to place your marker
O to turn on/off AI (will play whichever marker is not currently moving)

The AI is programmed to be unbeatable, though games against it will often result in ties. If the AI is turned off, the
players are hot seat switched.
